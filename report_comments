To pass the exam, I need to score a minimum of 70 points.
I have already 10 eligible points for having completed the PEN-200 course.
So, there are two possible ways to pass it.
- First, owning the three standalone machines would give me 20 x 3 + 10 = 70 points.
- Second, owning the Active Directory Controller and one of the standalone machines would make 40 + 20 + 10 = 70 points.
